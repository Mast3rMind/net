# Routing
How should packets be routed from A to B?
Should they take the shortest path? The most secure path?

#### Basics
###### Flooding
Every router sends the packet to every interface but not to the one who sent it to them. We are sure that the packet will be delivered, but it can very easily form a loop.

* We are sure that the packet is going to arrive.
* We can use it without knowing about the network topology
* Inefficient

###### Source routing
The source decides the whole path it is going to take between nodes. The routers need no forwarding tables, because all decisions are taken at the end hosts. 

* Respects the end-to-end principle
* Destination host knows exactly what route to take if wants to respond

###### Forwarding table
* Network handles hop by hop routinh
* Requires population of forwarding tables.
* Per each of destination, we know the next step.

Spanning tree -> We want to make sure that we can reach every destination, but trying to avoid loop creation. 

Choices when creating a spanning tree:
* Minimum geographic distance
* Minimum amount of hops
* Minimum delay
* Most reliable path
* Least loaded path
* Most secure
* Lowest/higher path

The routes are going to exchange information with each other

###### Multipath 
We spread the packets to a single destination using different paths.

This could cause packets to arrive in not the correct order, but IP doesn't assure this anyway

###### Multicast
A host wants to send packets to multiple hosts. We use the graph structure to replicate messages.

#### Bellman Ford
How can routers work together to find the minimum cost spanning tree.

We assume routers know the cost to each neighbor.

When we know about the cost of getting to our networks, we will broadcast to our neighbors. This way we can propagate and end up creating a table of what is the cost of getting to any destination through a precise neighbor.

It has some problems that can be easily fixed, so everything ends up convering.

It is a distance vector algorithm. It was used in RIP, the first internet routing protocol. 

#### Dijkstra
Shortest's path first algorithm -> link state algorithm

Exchange link state periodically and on link state change.
