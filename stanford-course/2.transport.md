# Transport
The transport layer runs on top of the network layer.
##Â TCP
Used by 95% of Internet apps. 

Stablishes a two-way communication channel: **connection**

It uses a threeway handshake to connect:

A (SYN) -> B *Syncronize*
B (SYN+ACK) -> A *Syncronize + acknoledge*
A (ACK) -> B *Acknoledge*

Syn is what A will use to send packets to B in a way that B can order the packets.
Ack is what B will use to send packets to A.

The stream of bytes is sent by a TCP segment that can be as big as IP datagram supports.

When A and B are over, they have to do a connection teardown. 

A (Fin) -> B
B (Data + Ack) -> A *B might have more data to send before closing the connection*
B (Fin) -> A

####TCP services:
* Stream delivery -> reliable byte delivery service
* Reliable delivery -> using acks to indicate correct delivery of data, sequence numbers to know that there's no missing pices and checksums to be sure that data hasn't been corrupted along the way. If something fails, data will have to be resent. Flow-control is a way to tell the peer you are communicating to whether you can receive more streams or not, so the peer sending data has to slow down.
* In sequence -> Data is sorted in the right order.
* Congestion control

####TCP Segment
* Source port -> So when response comes back we can differenciate among other connections.
* Destination port -> TCP default port is 80
* Sequence # and Acknowledge sequence #
* Checksum

##UDP
Apps that don't need reliable connection.
Simple way to send messages from one host to another without being sure whether the message will or will not be sent.

####UDP Services
* Connectionless
* Unreliable -> no acks, no sequence, no flow control

####UDP datagram
* Source port
* Destination port
* Optional checksum (that includes part of the IP header)

##ICPM

ICMP has a code and also has inside part of the IP header and data, so it can be identified.
####ICPM Services
* Reporting message -> self contained message reporting error.
* Unreliable -> no retries.

####Ping 
Sends a ICMP packet 0,8 (echo) that gets replied with 0, 0 (echo) back if the host is up.

####Traceroute
Sends a UDP packet with TTL 1 so that when it gets to the first host this one replies with an ICPM packet that indicates that TTL has expired. Doing this over and over will result in knowing the whole route the IP packet went through.


##End to end principle
There are many thing sthe network could do to improve our apps, but it doesn't. It is not possible to have security in the network such that applications don't have to worry about it. Because application have to be resposible for that end-to-end.

Example: file sharing.

Source -> B -> C -> Destination *Error detection at each link*

So we could say that if there's no errors in the link, we can assume that the data arrives correctly at the end. But the problem is that if there's an error in one of the nodes and flippes some bits, when it is sent to the link there will be no error, so we think the data arrived correctly because there were no errors.

That's why we need to check integrity at the application layer and we cannot rely on the network for doing that for us.

Stuff in the middle can help you, but if you rely on it rather than doing end to end checks, bad stuff could happen.

####Strong end to end
If the network implements something to help, it has to make assumptions about what is on top. This can be an impediment to future innovation, because we are designing the layer thinking about helping the layer on top.

This could make the network to perform better and better, but it could become harder to change.

##Finite state machines
A FSM is composed of a finite number of states the system can be in. 

We have to define the event that causes state transition and the actions that happen when the transition happens. The system can only be in one state, so for each event, only one transition from one state to another is possible.

You should handle every event for every state.
